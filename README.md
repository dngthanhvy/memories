# Memories

This is a web application made using React/Redux, Node/Express and MongoDB.

The website allows the user to log in and post "memories", which consist of a title, a message and a picture illustrating an event. Each memory can be liked by other users, including yourself. The authentication system uses JWT tokens that are stored locally until they're expired.
